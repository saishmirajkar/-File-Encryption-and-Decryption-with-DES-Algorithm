## Introduction

Welcome to the File Encryption and Decryption project with the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm. This Java program demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt image files using symmetric key encryption. By encoding the image data into unreadable form and then converting it back, the program provides data security during transmission and storage.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Any image file (e.g., .jpg, .png)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saishmirajkar/File-Encryption-and-Decryption-with-DES-Algorithm.git
```

2. Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

3. Replace the file paths in the code with the paths of your image files.

4. Compile and run the Java program:

```bash
javac Myclass.java
java Myclass
```

5. The program will encrypt the image and save it to the specified output file location.

6. It will then decrypt the encrypted image and save it to another output file location.

## Additional Information

In the digital era, data security and integrity are paramount. With the increasing transmission of data over computer networks, there is a growing concern about protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access. Cryptography provides a solution to this challenge by converting original data into unreadable form, referred to as ciphertext, using algorithms and keys.

The DES algorithm is one of the most widely-used symmetric key encryption algorithms. It employs a single key for both encryption and decryption processes. DES operates on a block of data and applies a series of transformation rounds to create the ciphertext. The strength of DES lies in the secrecy of the key; the more challenging it is to determine the key value, the more secure the encryption.

## Technologies Used

- Java: For implementing the file encryption and decryption program.
- Data Encryption Standard (DES) Algorithm: For symmetric key encryption.
- Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA): For cryptographic functionalities.

## Implementation Details

The Java program leverages the DES algorithm from the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) to encrypt and decrypt image files. The program creates a key using the KeyGenerator class and initializes the Cipher with the generated key for encryption and decryption purposes. It then reads the input image file, applies the encryption algorithm using the Cipher, and saves the encrypted image to the specified output file location. The program then decrypts the encrypted image back to its original form and saves it to another output file location.

## Security Considerations

While the DES algorithm is effective for securing data, it is important to consider the key management process and protect the key from unauthorized access. As technology advances, the security landscape evolves, and encryption algorithms need to be reviewed and updated to ensure robust data protection.
